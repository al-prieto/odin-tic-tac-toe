# odin-tic-tac-toe
⭕❌ A browser-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Two players take turns placing X or O on a 3×3 grid, and the first to align three in a row wins! Built as part of The Odin Project curriculum, this project emphasizes modular JavaScript, applying patterns like factory and module for clean, maintainable code.
